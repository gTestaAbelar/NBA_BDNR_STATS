Cypher query to add seasons:

Create seasons:
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM 'file:///games.csv' AS row
MERGE (s: Season {year: row.SEASON + "-"+toString(toInteger(row.SEASON)+1)})

Create Teams:
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM 'file:///teams.csv' AS row
MERGE (t: Team {id: row.TEAM_ID, nickname: row.NICKNAME, abbreviation: row.ABBREVIATION, city: row.CITY, arena: row.ARENA })

Create Games:
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM 'file:///games.csv' AS row
MERGE (g: Game {id: row.GAME_ID, date: date(row.GAME_DATE_EST)})

Add relationship between games and seasons:
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM 'file:///games.csv' AS row
MERGE (g:Game {id: row.GAME_ID})
MERGE (s:Season {year: row.SEASON + "-"+toString(toInteger(row.SEASON)+1)})
MERGE (g)-[:FROM_SEASON]->(s)

Add arena to each game: (execute after create_home_away.py)
MATCH (g:Game)-[:HOME_TEAM]->(t:Team)
SET g.arena = t.arena
